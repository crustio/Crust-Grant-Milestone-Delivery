# Milestone Delivery

> Only the GitHub account, which is responsible for the pull request of the accepted application is allowed to submit milestones.

Before submit this milestone delivery, please make sure: **The [invoice form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxKTRtoMzvqQiBL71YXA6gxl_XSsyNBHEBksFFC2AwWReU1w/viewform?usp=sf_link) has been filled out correctly for this milestone and the delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**

Please provide `PR Link` and `Milestone Number` at following.

- **PR Link:** https://github.com/crustio/Crust-Grants-Program/pull/49
- **Milestone Number:** 1

Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we suggest you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work.

| Number | Deliverable                        | PR Link  |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|     1. | We provide multiple blockchain choices, decentralized metadata storage |  |
|   2. | We connect to multiple tradeplaces like OpenSea, OpenDAO, Showme, etc. |  |
|    3 | We provide a 100% code-free tool to support creators to create 10K NFT collections and minters to mint. | |
|   4 | We enable the DAO on CrustNFT, and will carry on any decision from the DAO, and be funded by the DAO, like OpenDAO (SOS - for now totally offchain governance, not really accontable) and Uniswap (UNI - most of parameters on chain for governance). |  |
