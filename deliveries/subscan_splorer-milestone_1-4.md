## Overview

Subscan has supported the Crust network for nearly one year, and provided basic explorer services for the Crust testnet.

For Crust's special storage-related functions, Subscan does not provide customization support before. Users need to switch between Subscan and splorer to get the complete information of blockchain.

In order to improve the user experience, we will provide customized services for Crust storage related functions, then users can obtain a one-stop explorer query experience more conveniently.

In addition, the maxwell network has a dual-token design, we will support CSM balance display, transfer and other related functions.

## Project Details 

The main task is to integrate the storage-related functions of splorer into the Subscan blockchain explorer, which includes the following tasks:
* Product and interaction design for Crust network and Maxwell network..
* Server-side development for Crust network and Maxwell network.
* Customized UI and front-end development for Crust network and Maxwell network.
* Storage-related open API and API Docs for Crust network and Maxwell network.
* Support CSM balance display, transfer and other related functions for Maxwell network.
