### Overview

Subscan has supported the Crust network for nearly one year, and provided basic explorer services for the Crust testnet.

For Crust's special storage-related functions, Subscan does not provide customization support before. Users need to switch between Subscan and splorer to get the complete information of blockchain.

In order to improve the user experience, we will provide customized services for Crust storage related functions, then users can obtain a one-stop explorer query experience more conveniently.

In addition, the maxwell network has a dual-token design, we will support CSM balance display, transfer and other related functions.
