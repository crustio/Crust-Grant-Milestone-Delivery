# Milestone Delivery

> Only the GitHub account, which is responsible for the pull request of the accepted application is allowed to submit milestones. 

Before submit this milestone delivery, please make sure: **The [invoice form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxKTRtoMzvqQiBL71YXA6gxl_XSsyNBHEBksFFC2AwWReU1w/viewform?usp=sf_link) has been filled out correctly for this milestone and the delivery is according to the official [milestone delivery guidelines](milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md).**  

Please provide `PR Link` and `Milestone Number` at following.
* **PR Link:** Provide a link to the initial accepted pull request of your application to the [Crust Grants Program repository](https://github.com/crustio/Crust-Grants-Program). 
* **Milestone Number:** The number of the milestone

Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we suggest you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work.
