# Crust Grant Milestone Delivery

**:loudspeaker: Important:** This repository is only for submitting finished milestones for the [Crust Grants Program](https://github.com/crustio/Crust-Grants-Program). 


## Milestone Delivery Process

For each milestone you have reached, go through following processes to get corresponding payment.

1. **Milestone Delivery:**
   1. [Fork](https://github.com/crustio/Crust-Grant-Milestone-Delivery/fork) this repository with the **same GitHub account** that you used to submit the application.
   2. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the milestone delivery template ([`deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md`](deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md)) under the directory `deliveries/`. Make sure you **do not modify the template file directly**.
   3. Name the file `project_name-milestone_number.md`.
   4. Fill out the template with the details of your milestone including a **link to the pull request** of your application.
   5. Once you're done, create a pull request.
2. **Milestone Review:**
   1. [DCF Grants Commitee](https://github.com/crustio/Crust-Grants-Program#DCF-Grants-Committee) will issue comments and request changes on the pull request. The feedback needs to be resolved before your milestone is accepted.
   2. [DCF Grants Commitee](https://github.com/crustio/Crust-Grants-Program#DCF-Grants-Committee) will merge your pull request to accept the delivery.
3. **Milestone Payment:**
   1. Fill out the [invoice form](https://forms.gle/mPYWxAVbaBbVc737A)(if you choose to receive CRU, please contact us via email hi@crust.network before filling out the invoice form to know the exchange rate).
   2. Payment is made to the Ethereum address specified in the initial application. 

Grant applications can be amended at any time. If your application has been accepted and, during development, you find that your project significantly deviates from the original specification, please open a new pull request that modifies the existing application.
